This repository has some js-native plugins. Maybe it can be useful ^_^

For start project you need to have node js.
Then, you should install a parcel globally.
```shell
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```
Now we can change path to current js plugin. For example, _slider
```shell
cd _slider
```
Start the project.
```shell
parcel index.html
```
